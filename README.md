Strafing Dummy mod for r5 flowstate aim trainer. Speed adjusts strafe length(from shortest to longest). If you enable Play As Dummy, bot will have variable strafe lengths.

Bot has logic that makes it move away from your crosshair. Each bot that spawns behaves slightly differently when you are on target(tendency to AD spam, or long strafe).

The bot also doesn't perfectly "track" you(still needs some work). This will give you incentive to move away from where its looking yourself.

Replaced Tile Frenzy with recording of your movement during Strafing Dummy challenge.

Unzip and place platform folder into r5 directory.

NOTE: This will never be a replacement for real human strafes, so don't use this as a replacement for normal 1v1s.
